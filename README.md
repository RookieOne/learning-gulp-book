# Learning Gulp

Gulp has been a real treat to work with and I wanted to share
the ease of which you can use it to quickly create an awesome build.

We are going to be using gulp to build a static content generation site like Jeykll. Obviously it will not be super feature rich, but the basics will be mapped out.

By the end we will have a build script that will run on file change. The content for the pages will be pulled from data and converted markdown. We will have a preview web server that will live reload with these changes. Then we can then publish our site to a GitHub page.
